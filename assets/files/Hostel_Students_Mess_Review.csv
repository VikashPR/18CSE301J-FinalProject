I suggest reducing variety and focusing on the taste of food + having a survey at the end of the week to find the feedback of the students as to, if they enjoyed the food, what could be improved, etc. And more importantly, act upon the feedback instead of it falling on deaf ears.

The reason for wastage of food is none other than low quality of food. If the food is good, I'm sure no one would want to eat from canteens. We certainly feel that the food items that are in the menu and even quality are not upto the mark. For 65000 that we're paying, we deserve much more better food. Sambar should be improved. Rice items such as biryani, fried rice, pulao should be improved significantly. We don't want to waste our money by eating out either. Pure Curd should be provided everyday rather than curd rice. I'm more than happy to come to the mess if the quality improves. I'm certainly disappointed that the quality of food we're getting for 65000"

Bringing back bajji instead of vada could be a better choice of snack as the vada that is being provided currently isnt good and tastes like a combination of 2types of vadas (2) the tamarind rice provided tastes very bad,thereby , bringing an alternative for it would be better (4) providing poori and pongal on saturday is kinda overwhelming and thus, any one of them could be provided on Saturdays and other one could be provided on either friday or thursday (5) corn could be replaced with samosa again"

People who have white rice often don't have enough side dishes in the days of veg biryani, curd rice etc. The only side dishes available those days are salads.    2) Please serve eggs everyday. Eggs are a great source of protein and serving them just twice a week isn't enough. Many people needs eggs for weight gain. Especially our hostel food lacks protein supply   3) Please include fried items of chicken or fish in our diet.   4) Please include beef in the menu if possible. By saying this, I don't mean to offend anyone. Red meat is perfect for weight gain and it is necessary for people who have lost above 15kgs by having hostel food.      5) Please serve chilly chicken on non veg days.      6) And the best way to avoid food wastage is making payment for mess food optional when people opt for hostel rooms during the time of payments.

Instead, they can focus on incorporating healthier options such as sprouts, boiled vegetables, fruit salad and protein-enriched foods. These additions not only provide essential nutrients but also add variety to the menu. Additionally, the mess can explore cooking techniques that use minimal oil to reduce the amount of excess oil in dishes. This will ultimately contribute to the overall health and satisfaction of the students."

Also it is very disappointing that shops like big save close at 8 inside the hostel premises because there are cases where girls need emergency materials at certain point in time. Kindly do not shut down essentials as it affects us.

That was not that huge a problem when we started to find bugs and insects in the food. Now I don't feel comfortable eating anything from the mess. Also lack of cutlery at all times. The plates were almost never washed properly and one could see first and previous meal clearly on the plates. The cucumber served was often at the rotting stage as it was very slimy to touch and had an odour to it. The chapati was almost always raw. The quality seriously needs to be regulated and checked upon.

5/9/2023 19:34:27,ss2321@srmist.edu.in,Oori,Sometimes,Poor food quality,Never,Yes,"Food tends to get very repetitive and sometimes the flavour of the food is a bit too strong. On days when there is non veg, it makes no point to limit the consumption to one bowl. Closing shops, especially convenience stores is not the solution, if kids are going to alternative places instead of the mess they have already payed for, there is something that can be corrected within the mess. Most people don't like parotta, and it takes much effort to make them too, so it's best that it was scraped off from the menu. Buttermilk must be made present during dinner too, or even curd will do just fine.the mess fee was exorbitant, but the food that is given compared compared to what you take is just leeching off at this point. People would complain less if the mess fee that is collected would make sense, but unfortunately it doesn't. We don't like wasting our money too, and when i say this, i mean that i also would like to eat at the mess, but it is proving hard to do so."
